Act as a Senior Full-Stack Data Engineer. Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a data visualization dashboard.

Use skill: create-prd

### FEATURE SCOPE

Build a multi-tab Streamlit web application to visualize the mart-layer insights for competitive Pokemon analytics.

- **Backend:** Connection to the local DuckDB `data/pokedex.db` (or BigQuery if Lab 3 is completed)
- **Location:** All application code in the `app/` directory

### DASHBOARD TABS

1. **Power Rankings** — Searchable table of Pokemon with Base Stat Total (BST). Radar chart to compare stats of two selected Pokemon side by side.

2. **Type Synergy & Counters** — Heatmap visualization of the type effectiveness matrix from `dim_type_effectiveness`. Interactive tool: select an opponent's Pokemon and see top 5 counters based on type advantages.

3. **Move Pool Analytics** — Distribution plot of move accuracy vs. power. List of highest damage dealers per type, factoring in STAB bonus from `fct_competitive_moves`.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

- Use `duckdb` Python library (or `google-cloud-bigquery`) to query the mart models directly
- Use `plotly` or `altair` for interactive charts
- Sidebar with global filters (e.g., generation, primary type) that persist across tabs
- Project structure:
  - `app/main.py` — Entry point
  - `app/utils.py` — Database connection and SQL queries
  - `app/visuals.py` — Chart generation functions
