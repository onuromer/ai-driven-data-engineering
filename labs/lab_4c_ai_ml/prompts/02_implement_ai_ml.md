# Prompt: Implement BQML and Gemini Queries

Copy the following prompt into your AI coding assistant:

---

Use skill: implement-tasks

Read the AI/ML tasks in `docs/tasks/` and implement BQML and Gemini features.

### BQML CLASSIFICATION MODEL

Create SQL files for the following steps:

**1. Training (`ml/train_type_classifier.sql`)**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `<project>.<dataset>.pokemon_type_classifier`
OPTIONS (
  model_type='LOGISTIC_REG',  -- or 'BOOSTED_TREE_CLASSIFIER'
  input_label_cols=['primary_type']
) AS
SELECT
  hp, attack, defense, sp_attack, sp_defense, speed,
  primary_type
FROM `<project>.<dataset>.fct_pokemon_stats`
WHERE primary_type IS NOT NULL;
```

**2. Evaluation (`ml/evaluate_model.sql`)**
- Use `ML.EVALUATE` to check accuracy, precision, recall
- Display a confusion matrix if possible

**3. Prediction (`ml/predict_types.sql`)**
- Use `ML.PREDICT` on a subset of Pokemon
- Show predicted type vs. actual type

### GEMINI SCOUTING REPORTS

Create a SQL query (`ml/scouting_report.sql`) that uses `ML.GENERATE_TEXT`:

- Join `fct_pokemon_stats` with `fct_competitive_moves` to build a context prompt
- For each Pokemon, generate a prompt like:
  > "Analyze this Pokemon for competitive play: [name], Type: [type], Stats: HP=[hp], ATK=[atk], DEF=[def], SpA=[spa], SpD=[spd], Spe=[spe]. Top moves: [move_list]. Provide a scouting report covering strengths, weaknesses, and recommended competitive role."
- Use `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` with the Gemini model to generate the report
- Return: pokemon_name, primary_type, bst, scouting_report

### NOTES

- Replace `<project>` and `<dataset>` with actual values from the Terraform outputs or environment
- The Gemini remote model connection may need to be created first — check with the instructor
- These can be implemented as standalone SQL files or as dbt models in `transform/models/ml/`
