# Lab 0 — Plan It: Context Engineering & Project Planning

In this lab, you'll use your AI coding assistant for the first time — not to write code, but to **plan the project**. You'll create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and break it into actionable tasks using the pre-configured skills in your starter project.

This is where most "vibe coding" goes wrong: people jump straight to implementation. By starting with structured planning, you give the AI the context it needs to produce consistent, high-quality output in Labs 1 and 2.

## Learning Objectives

- Experience the `create-prd` skill: guided requirements gathering through AI conversation
- Experience the `create-tasks` skill: AI-driven task decomposition into vertical slices
- Understand how PRDs and task files serve as persistent context for future AI interactions
- See the difference between a vague prompt and a well-structured planning session

## Tools

| | |
|---|---|
| **Tool type** | CLI (Claude Code or Antigravity CLI) |
| **Environment** | Local |
| **Duration** | 60–75 minutes |

## Prerequisites

- Starter project cloned and set up (see `starter/README.md`)
- Python environment active with dependencies installed
- Your CLI tool configured and working

## Steps

### Step 1 — Set Up Your Project (10 min)

Before you start prompting, set up your own git repository and explore the starter project.

1. If you haven't already, set up your own project (see [Setup Guide](../../SETUP.md), steps 8–10):
   ```bash
   cp -r starter/ ~/my-pokedex-project
   cd ~/my-pokedex-project
   git init && git checkout -b development
   git add . && git commit -m "initial project scaffold"
   uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This creates a **local-only git repo** — no remote, no risk of pushing anywhere.
2. Explore the key files:
   - `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` — Project-level instructions for your AI assistant
   - `AGENTS.md` — Agent workflow rules, coding standards, and testing guidelines
   - `.agents/skills/` — The 6 skills that define your development workflow
3. Start your AI coding assistant in the project directory

### Step 2 — Create the PRD (30 min)

Now use the `create-prd` skill to generate a Product Requirements Document. The AI will ask you clarifying questions — your answers shape the scope of the entire project.

1. Copy the prompt from [`prompts/01_create_prd.md`](prompts/01_create_prd.md) into your AI assistant
2. The AI will ask clarifying questions about the project scope — answer them based on the guidance in the prompt
3. Review the generated PRD in `docs/prds/`
4. Refine if needed: ask the AI to adjust scope, add details, or restructure sections

**Tips:**
- The AI will ask clarifying questions with recommended defaults — **when in doubt, pick the recommended option**. The prompt file has guidance on sensible answers.
- Don't overthink the answers — the goal is to practice the *process*, not design the perfect architecture
- Once the PRD is generated, don't just accept it — iterate on it like you would with a colleague
- Pay attention to the functional requirements section — this drives the tasks in the next step
- Make sure the PRD covers both ingestion (dlt) and transformation (dbt) scope

### Step 3 — Create the Task Breakdown (20 min)

With the PRD in place, use the `create-tasks` skill to break it into implementation tasks.

1. Copy the prompt from [`prompts/02_create_tasks.md`](prompts/02_create_tasks.md) into your AI assistant
2. The AI will generate high-level parent tasks first — review them before proceeding
3. When prompted, type **"Go"** to generate the detailed sub-tasks
4. Review the task file in `docs/tasks/`

**Tips:**
- Each parent task should be a complete vertical slice (code + tests + docs)
- Check that the tasks align with what the PRD describes
- The task list is what you'll work through in Labs 1 and 2

### Step 4 — Review and Validate (10 min)

Take a step back and review what your AI assistant produced.

1. Read through the PRD — does it accurately describe the project?
2. Read through the tasks — are they actionable? Do they cover the full scope?
3. Make any final adjustments

Ask yourself: *"If I handed these documents to a colleague (or an AI), could they build the project without additional context?"* If yes, you're ready for Lab 1.

## Checkpoints

- [ ] PRD file exists in `docs/prds/` (e.g., `prd-pokedex-data-platform.md`)
- [ ] PRD covers ingestion scope (PokeAPI endpoints, dlt, DuckDB destination)
- [ ] PRD covers transformation scope (dbt staging + marts models)
- [ ] Task file exists in `docs/tasks/` (e.g., `tasks-prd-pokedex-data-platform.md`)
- [ ] Tasks are broken into vertical slices with implementation + testing sub-tasks
- [ ] Tasks cover both ingestion and transformation features

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| AI doesn't use the `create-prd` skill | Make sure you're in the project directory with `CLAUDE.md` and `.agents/skills/` present |
| PRD is too vague | Provide more specific answers during the clarification phase — mention specific endpoints, schemas, and tools |
| PRD scope is too large | Focus on core endpoints (pokemon, types, abilities, moves) and basic staging + marts models |
| Tasks are too high-level | Ask the AI to add more granular sub-tasks with specific file paths and test requirements |

## Next

Continue to [Lab 1 — Ingest It](../lab_1_ingestion/README.md) where you'll implement the ingestion pipeline using the tasks you just created.
