# Prompt: Create Tasks for Cloud Migration

Copy the following prompt into your AI coding assistant:

---

Use skill: create-tasks

Break down the **cloud deployment feature** from the updated PRD in `docs/prds/` into implementation tasks.

Focus on three areas:
1. **Terraform infrastructure** — create GCP resources (BigQuery datasets, GCS bucket)
2. **Pipeline adaptation** — update dlt and dbt to support BigQuery as a destination
3. **Testing** — verify the pipeline works end-to-end on GCP

Each parent task should be a complete vertical slice. Keep the existing ingestion and transformation tasks — add the cloud tasks as new entries.

---

**When the AI presents the high-level parent tasks**, check:
- Is there a clear task for Terraform?
- Is there a task for dlt adaptation (DuckDB → BigQuery)?
- Is there a task for dbt adaptation (dbt-duckdb → dbt-bigquery)?
- Is there a testing/validation task?

Type **"Go"** when ready for the detailed sub-tasks.
