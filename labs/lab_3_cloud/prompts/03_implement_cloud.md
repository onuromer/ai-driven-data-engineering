# Prompt: Implement Cloud Infrastructure & Pipeline Adaptation

Copy the following prompt into your AI coding assistant:

Use skill: implement-tasks

Read the cloud deployment tasks in `docs/tasks/` and implement them. This covers three areas:

### 1. TERRAFORM INFRASTRUCTURE

Create Terraform configurations in `infra/` that provision:

```
infra/
├── main.tf              # Provider config, backend
├── variables.tf         # Input variables (project_id, region, etc.)
├── bigquery.tf          # BigQuery datasets
├── storage.tf           # GCS bucket for dlt staging
├── outputs.tf           # Output values (dataset names, bucket URL)
└── terraform.tfvars     # Variable values (gitignored)
```

**Requirements:**
- Google Cloud provider
- BigQuery datasets: `pokedex_raw`, `pokedex_staging`, `pokedex_marts`
- GCS bucket for dlt staging files
- Use variables for `project_id` and `region` (don't hardcode)
- Add a `terraform.tfvars.example` with placeholder values

### 2. DLT PIPELINE ADAPTATION

Update the dlt pipeline to support both DuckDB and BigQuery:
- Use an environment variable (e.g., `PIPELINE_DESTINATION`) to switch between `duckdb` and `bigquery`
- Default to `duckdb` when no env var is set (local development)
- For BigQuery: use Application Default Credentials (`gcloud auth application-default login`)
- The BigQuery dataset should match the Terraform-created dataset

### 3. DBT PROFILE ADAPTATION

Update dbt to support BigQuery as a target:
- Add a `prod` target in `profiles.yml` using `dbt-bigquery`
- Keep the existing `dev` target (DuckDB) as the default
- `dbt build` should still work locally with DuckDB
- `dbt build --target prod` should target BigQuery

---

**While the AI works**, verify:
- Terraform files use variables, not hardcoded project IDs
- The dlt pipeline still works locally (DuckDB) without setting env vars
- dbt's `dev` target is unchanged
