---

Act as a Senior Data Engineer. Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for pipeline orchestration.

Use skill: create-prd

### FEATURE SCOPE

Add pipeline orchestration using Apache Airflow to schedule and automate the existing dlt + dbt data pipeline.

### REQUIREMENTS

- **DAG structure:** A single DAG that runs ingestion (dlt) followed by transformation (dbt)
- **Schedule:** Daily, configurable via Airflow variables
- **Tasks:**
  1. Run `ingestion/pipeline.py` (dlt → BigQuery)
  2. Run `dbt build --target prod` (dbt transformations)
- **Error handling:** Retry failed tasks up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Alerting:** Email notification on failure (configurable)
- **Location:** DAG files in `dags/` directory

### TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

- Use Airflow 2.x TaskFlow API or classic operators
- The DAG should work on both local Airflow and Google Cloud Composer
- Use `BashOperator` or `PythonOperator` for task execution
- No hardcoded paths or credentials — use Airflow Variables and Connections
